# Simple-Data-Entry-Django

Description:

This is a Django Project that simply allows you to type in 4 fields and returns the data you filled out, as well as any other data you've filled out prior to. 

How to run:

1. Clone this Repo
2. run 'pip install django'     (This will install django package on your whole system by default)
    
    --- To prevent a global install, create a virtualEnv within python to store local dependencies

3. cd into "Simple-Data-Entry-Django"
4. run 'python manage.py runserver'
5. open a browser at "http://localhost:8000"
6. Please let me know if you have any questions/suggestions!
